    <main>
        <h2>Art</h2>
        <p>“This world is but a canvas to our imagination.” – Henry David Thoreau</p>
        <p>The HDS art curriculum is designed to allow students to develop creativity, competency and curiosity.  The program enriches and extends the general and Judaic studies curriculum and encourages students to work to understand themselves, their heritage and the world around them. Guided by the State of Michigan and National Arts Education standards, students explore line, shape, form, color, value, texture, dimension, unity, balance, movement, rhythm, contrast, emphasis, and pattern.  Students also view and study works of great artists from the world.  All students from Gan (kindergarten) through fifth grade have studio art class once a week.</p>

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>Music enriches our lives and feeds our souls. At HDS, the music curriculum encourages students to enjoy music through the natural instrument within each person – the voice. They learn Hebrew and English songs about holidays, values, and Jewish and Israeli culture. All students sing, move, play rhythm instruments, and listen to a variety of musical styles with the goal of developing positive attitudes and appreciation of music. Starting in third grade, the students are introduced to music reading and theory through direct instruction. Currently, third and fourth graders learn to play the recorder and fifth graders learn to play a wind instrument such as the trumpet, trombone, euphonium, clarinet, saxophone, or flute. Students develop their abilities in the art of performance and experience the joy of a community coming together in music, as they have a variety of group performance opportunities.</p>
        <p>There is additional opportunity for music enrichment through joining the HDS Klez Kids band. This after school class brings together musicians of various ages and talents. Klez Kids perform throughout the year both at school functions such as Music Festival and Graduation, and around the community.</p>

        <h2>Physical Education</h2>
        <p>Active.  Healthy. Good Sports. The goals of the physical education program at HDS are to promote an active, healthy lifestyle, develop strong sportsmanship norms and expose students to a variety of sports and physical activities.  All activities are designed to be age-appropriate and focus on the important development of both the individual athlete and the sense of team.  Students set personal fitness goals and track their progress throughout the year.  HDS students participate in gym class twice a week facilitated by a physical education teacher.</p>

        <h2>Library</h2>
        <p>Our library program is designed to ignite a love of reading and literature. During weekly visits to the library, students discuss books related to themes inspired by their general and Judaic curricula. Through their interactions with the texts, students are guided in thinking critically, making inferences and predictions, asking questions, and sharing personal responses.</p>
        <p>Attention is focused on specific authors, illustrators and genres of literature. Students engage in projects that complement their classwork and learn how to use reference materials for their research. The students are encouraged to check out a variety of titles and are assisted in selecting literature that matches and expands their interests and abilities. Containing over 9,000 volumes, our library provides students and staff with a wide range of choices: secular and Judaic, English and Hebrew, fiction and non-fiction. We welcome and embrace the rapidly changing digital world, while continuing to cherish our nondigital books.</p>

        <h2>Social-Emotional Learning (SEL)</h2>
        <p>Social-emotional learning (SEL) is a vital component to education and child development. Through SEL, children develop skills in five key areas: self-awareness, self-control, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making. At Hebrew Day School, we believe that these “human skills” are just as important as academics. Students with a strong foundation in social and emotional skills are better able to cope with everyday challenges, manage their emotions, and navigate relationships. In a supportive, safe, and loving environment, students learn about themselves and others in lessons that are empowering, self-actualizing, and fun. SEL offers positive, long-term effects on students, the school, and the greater community.</p>

        <h2>Computer Science</h2>
        <p>The HDS Computer Science program strives to help students become proficient with using technology to enhance their learning. Students practice important computer skills like searching the Internet for a reliable source and creating a digital presentation. By practicing computational thinking and creative problem-solving skills, students gain confidence with technology as they are exposed to emerging trends in the digital world.</p>
        <p>In keeping with HDS’s mission of cross-curricular integration, students connect computer science to other spheres of learning like math and art. As part of HDS’ mensch curriculum, we emphasize the importance of responsible technology use and support students in developing healthy digital citizenship skills. Computer science learning provides students with an important foundation in technology that will boost their curiosity, empower them to seek knowledge, and show them how to make meaningful connections that extend beyond the classroom.</p>

        <h2>Instrumental</h2>
        <p>Students in upper el (Grades 3-5) have the opportunity to engage with a variety of instruments at different levels.</p>
