        <h2>Math</h2>
        <p>Children learn math through rich, hands-on, real-world experiences designed to develop their skills as intuitive mathematicians. Great emphasis is placed on conceptual understanding alongside consistent practice to promote accuracy and automaticity.  Together these promote a depth of understanding for the mathematical concepts explored. The Common Core State Standards and Michigan’s Grade Level Expectations guide and inspire a developmentally appropriate, focused and rigorous math curriculum. Students engage as active problem solvers by expressing multiple ways one can understand and attack problems.  Their reasoning is explored and developed as their competence and confidence as mathematicians grow.</p>

        <h2>Language Arts</h2>
        <p>HDS students learn in a comprehensive, developmental, and language-rich environment.   The foundational skills of reading, writing, speaking and listening are established in the Gan (kindergarten) and built upon throughout the years.  The Common Core State Standards and Michigan’s Grade Level Expectations serve to guide and inspire a wide range of literacy experiences designed to equip our students with the skills to communicate.  Our goals are to instill in students a lifelong love of reading, writing, speaking and listening, and an appreciation of the power and possibility of words.</p>

        <h2>Science</h2>
        <p>Science is curiosity and exploration.  Through discovery, students contemplate and investigate their ideas, curiosities and questions as they build a body of knowledge and experiences to draw upon and apply.  Science is also about developing the skills to make predictions, collect and interpret data, pose hypotheses and document results.  Using the scientific method and a cycle of inquiry, students at HDS build a strong knowledge base in earth, physical and life sciences.</p>

        <h2>Social Studies</h2>
        <p>Thoughtful, empowered and responsible citizenship begins in the elementary classroom.  Seeing connections to the past and future help students understand their place in the world, their community and their families.  At HDS, the social studies curriculum is carefully integrated with the language arts and Judaic studies curriculum to help students make these connections explicit.  The curriculum comes alive through fiction and non-fiction texts, current events and primary source documents.</p>
