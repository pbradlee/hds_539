        <h2>Hebrew</h2>
        <p>The idea of Hebrew as a second language begins with the observation that fluency in any second language adds a rich dimension to a person’s education.  Learning a second language at a young age enables learners to become competent and secure in their skills.  Beginning with the first day of Gan, our students interact with and learn Hebrew daily, making it a natural part of their lives.</p>
        <p>Some of the amazing things our students accomplish during their years at Hebrew Day School are the abilities to learn to read, write, speak, listen, present and think critically in two languages.  Our Hebrew and Judaic studies teachers are on the cutting edge of standards integration as evidenced by a commitment to implement appropriate parts of the English Language Arts standards of Common Core State Standards in their Hebrew and Judaic classrooms.</p>
        <p>As a unifying thread of our rich heritage, Hebrew is taught as a living language as well as a necessary component in the study of liturgy and ancient Jewish texts. They develop the ability to think, question, and make connections.  By learning and speaking Hebrew, our students strengthen their relationship with the Jewish People and with modern Israel.</p>

        <h2>Judaic Studies</h2>
        <p>Confident, competent, connected.  An HDS student lives a rich Jewish life at school by engaging in meaningful rituals, joyful holiday celebrations and deep Torah study.  Students gain the confidence necessary to read Hebrew texts, express themselves, ask questions and delve deeply into the curriculum.  Students develop a strong connection to the State of Israel through meaningful cultural experiences.</p>
        <p>As the only Jewish day school in Ann Arbor, HDS draws students from families from the widest variety of Jewish observance.  Through this experience, students learn not only to respect diversity, but to expect it.</p>

        <h2>Mitzvot</h2>
        <p>Hebrew Day School teaches its students to identify ethical and socially responsible behavior as expressions of authentic Jewish values. When our students and graduates think about what it means to be Jewish, they think about Jewish holidays and rituals, the Hebrew language and their personal connection to the State of Israel. Just as quickly, they think of imperatives such as giving tzedakah, loving their neighbors as themselves, and proceeding always on the understanding that every human being is equally created be-tzelem elohim (in God’s image).</p>

        <h2>T'Fillot</h2>
        <p>Students feel connected to their school community through the common bonds of a shared heritage and the ability to learn and explore it together. This community is enhanced and extended through participation in community t’filot (prayers). In the lower elementary grades, students use song and movement to learn both keva (the reliable routine of prayer) and kavanah (the personally felt meaning of prayer). As students move into the upper elementary classes, they take active leadership roles in t’filah and participate in a weekly Torah service. They learn Torah trope and try their hand at writing their own divrei Torah (commentaries).</p>
